# Welcome! Some quick facts about me:
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jaden
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in playing music, automation, puzzles
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C#
- ðŸ’ž To get in touch with me, you can contact me on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/95461045954412544)! 


Programming is something that I enjoy for the fact that it involves a lot of creative thinking to start a project, but the program itself must be logical, otherwise it won't work.
## Who am I?

Programming is something that I enjoy for the fact that it involves a lot of creative thinking to start a project, but the program itself must be logical, otherwise it won't work.
As I said earlier, my name is Jaden, but you can call me Bombearo if you want! I'm an 18 year old developer who has a strong interest in both programming and music. My skills include:
- Python
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Very Basic)
- C# (which I'm currently learning)

Currently, I'm experimenting with different niches and languages to see what I like doing more, and can see myself doing in the future. My primary focus at the moment is fullstack web development.
